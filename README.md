This was a class group project for CS 413 - Virtual Worlds at Northern Arizona University. These are the five memebers and their contributions:

Nick Wiley - Worked on enemeies and pathfinding.
AJ Mastrangelo - Worked on levels, modified the weapons, created the UI elements and health system.
Paul Mayoral - Worked on playercontrol and initial weapons.
Charles Diaz - Worked on score system.
Ceanna Jarrett - Worked on level design.

Ceanna is not on this repo's contributer's section because she had issues pushing to github but she did work on this project as well. We had someone else push her changes for her.
